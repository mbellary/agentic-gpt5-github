Next steps (for the implementation phase, outside this PM role):

1. Create a feature branch following the project’s branch guidelines.
2. Implement `greet(name: str, place: str) -> None` in `greetings.py` to print `Hello {name} from {place}`.
3. Add/update tests (likely in `tests/test_greetings.py`).
4. Run `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run ruff check . --fix`, and `uv run pytest --cov`.
5. Open a PR following the repo’s PR template and link it to Issue #4

- Create a feature branch following `.github/BRANCH/branch.md`, and
- Implement the function + tests and then open a PR using `.github/PULL_REQUEST/pull_request.md` as the template.


1. Create a feature branch per `.github/BRANCH/branch.md` (something like `feature/add-greet-with-place`).
2. Implement the `greet(name: str, place: str)` function in `greetings.py`.
3. Add/extend tests to cover this behavior.
4. Run formatting, linting, and tests:
   - `uv run ruff format .`
   - `uv run ruff check . --fix`
   - `uv run pytest --cov`
5. Open a PR linked to Issue #49 using `.github/PULL_REQUEST/pull_request.md` as the template.




3. **Next steps for implementation (for your local workflow)**

   From your local clone of the repo:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout feature/add-greet-name-place
   ```

   In `greetings.py`, add something like:

   ```python
   def greet(name: str, place: str) -> None:
       print(f"Hello {name} from {place}")
   ```

   Then run the documented workflow:

   ```bash
   uv run ruff format .
   uv run ruff check . --fix
   uv run pytest --cov
   git commit -am "feat: add greet function with name and place"
   git push -u origin feature/add-greet-name-place
   ```

When you’re ready, I can also help draft the pull request using the `.github/PULL_REQUEST/pull_request.md` conventions and link it to Issue #63.


You (or another contributor) can now implement the function on this branch and open a PR that links to Issue #64.


## 3. Next Steps You (or a Dev) Can Take

On your machine, you can now:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbellary/greetings-lib.git
cd greetings-lib
git checkout feature/extended-greet-bye-functions
# Implement:
# - new greet(name, place) in greetings.py that prints "Hello {name} from {place}"
# - new bye(name) in bye.py that returns "Bye {name} !!"
# - add/update unit tests
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run pytest --cov
git commit -am "feat: add extended greet and bye helpers"
git push -u origin feature/extended-greet-bye-functions
```

Then open a PR from `feature/extended-greet-bye-functions` to the configured target branch, following `.github/PULL_REQUEST/pull_request.md` (include “Fixes #66”, checklist, etc.).

If you’d like, I can next:
- Draft the exact `greet(...)` and `bye(...)` implementations and test stubs, or
- Draft the PR description text following the PR template.

3. **Next steps for implementation (for your reference)**
   In the `feature/greet-and-bye-helpers` branch, the work should include:
   - Implement `greet(name: str, place: str)` in `greetings.py`:
     - Build the string `f"Hello {name} from {place}"`.
     - Use `print(...)` to output it.
   - Implement `bye(name: str)` in `bye.py`:
     - Return `f"Bye {name} !!"` (no printing).
   - Add/update tests to cover both functions.
   - Run the workflow from `branch.md`:
     - `uv run ruff format .`
     - `uv run ruff check . --fix`
     - `uv run pytest --cov`
   - Push the branch and open a PR targeting the appropriate base (per PR template), linking **Issue #67** (e.g., `Fixes #67`) and using `.github/PULL_REQUEST/pull_request.md` as the checklist.
